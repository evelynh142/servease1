A server to connect between waiters and customers in the most convience way.
# Inspiration
My teammate and I both have work experience in restaurants as a server. With the customers always looking around to find a server and servers getting stressed out at peak time walking the same route back and forth just to get a single fork, we found the current way of customer-server communication has been inefficient and prone to error. To improve the restaurant's service performance and social presence, and to boost the customer experience at the same time, we decided to design a webpage that can send specific requests to waiters as customers and receive real-time interactions from customers as waiters. We aim to facilitate an effective and more agreeable way of communication between restaurant staff and patrons, and to soothe the haste of fast-paced social interactions to build closer bonds between people.

# What it does
The customer's website would be activated after scanning the table-specific QR code and several quick tabs would show up such as "water", "to-go box", "pay in-person" etc. The customer can then click one of them or customize in the "+" and input the number of items and other details of the request. Once a request is sent, screens on the waiters' devices will all be updated and they can see whether there is someone who has picked up and taken care of the request. There will also be a space for meme interactions or short message communications for every past request to let the people give warm feedback to each other.
